## Module Responsibilities

### `server/index.js` — Orchestrator

Wires all modules together. Exports `createTermBeamServer()` which creates the Express app, HTTP server, WebSocket server, and returns `{ app, server, wss, sessions, config, auth, start, shutdown }`. The `start()` method begins listening and creates the default session. Handles process lifecycle (shutdown, uncaught exceptions).

### `cli/index.js` — CLI Interface

Parses command-line arguments and environment variables. Returns a config object used by all other modules. Includes platform-specific shell auto-detection: on Windows it walks the process tree (via `wmic`) looking for PowerShell or cmd.exe; on Unix it inspects the parent process via `ps` and falls back to `$SHELL` or `/bin/sh`.

### `server/auth.js` — Authentication

Factory function `createAuth(password)` returns an object with middleware, token management, rate limiting, and the login page HTML.

### `server/sessions.js` — Session Manager

`SessionManager` class wraps the PTY lifecycle. Handles spawning, tracking, listing, updating, and cleaning up terminal sessions. Each session has an auto-assigned color, tracks `lastActivity` timestamps, a `createdAt` timestamp, and supports live updates via the `update()` method. Sessions maintain a scrollback buffer with a high/low-water mark (trimmed back to ~500k characters when it grows beyond 1,000,000 characters) that is sent to newly connecting clients, and track a `clients` Set of active WebSocket connections. Supports an optional `initialCommand` that is written to the PTY shortly after spawn. The `list()` method detects the live working directory of the shell process (via `lsof` on macOS, `/proc` on Linux) and enriches each session with git repository information, using an async cache to avoid blocking the event loop. Includes a process-tree monitor that polls for child process exits every 2 seconds (via `ps` + `awk` to count descendant processes), enabling command-completion detection for push notifications.

### `utils/git.js` — Git Repository Detection

Detects git repository information for a given directory. Provides `getGitInfo(cwd)` which returns branch name, remote provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps), repository name, and working tree status (staged, modified, untracked counts plus ahead/behind tracking). Also exports `parseRemoteUrl()` and `parseStatus()` for URL parsing and status summarization. All git commands use a 3-second timeout to avoid hanging.

### `server/routes.js` — HTTP Routes

Registers all Express routes: login page (`GET /login`), auth API, session CRUD (including `PATCH` for updating session color/name), shell detection, directory browser, image upload, version endpoint. The `POST /api/sessions` endpoint validates `shell` against detected shells and `cwd` against the filesystem, and accepts optional `args`, `initialCommand`, `color`, `cols`, and `rows` parameters.

### `server/websocket.js` — WebSocket Handler

Handles real-time communication: validates the Origin header to reject cross-origin connections, WebSocket-level authentication (password or token), session attachment, terminal I/O forwarding, and resize events. When multiple clients are connected to the same session, the PTY is resized to the minimum dimensions across active clients (active within the last 60 seconds). Idle clients are excluded from the size calculation so that a backgrounded phone tab does not constrain the terminal when resuming from a laptop. Sends keepalive pings every 15 seconds and terminates connections that do not reply with a pong.

### `server/push.js` — Push Notification Manager

`PushManager` class for Web Push notifications. Manages VAPID authentication, push subscriptions (in-memory), and notification delivery via the `web-push` npm package. Exposes methods for subscribing/unsubscribing clients and sending notifications when commands complete in a session.

### `server/preview.js` — Port Preview Proxy

Reverse-proxies HTTP requests from `/preview/:port/*` to services running on `127.0.0.1`. Allows previewing web apps started inside a terminal session without exposing additional ports. Handles proxy errors (502) and timeouts (504).

### `utils/shells.js` — Shell Detection

Detects available shells on the host system. Returns a list of shell objects with `name`, `path`, and `cmd` fields. Cross-platform: scans known paths on Unix and queries PATH via the `where` command on Windows.

### `utils/logger.js` — Logger

Structured logger with configurable levels (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`). Used by all modules. Level is set via `--log-level` flag or `TERMBEAM_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

### `tunnel/index.js` — DevTunnel

Manages Azure DevTunnel lifecycle: login, create, host, cleanup. Includes a **watchdog** that keeps the tunnel connection reliable:

- **Health check** — every 30 seconds, runs `devtunnel show` and parses the host connection count.
- **Zombie detection** — if host connections drop to 0 for two consecutive checks (60s grace), the stale process is killed and a restart is initiated.
- **Crash detection** — an `exit` handler on the child process triggers immediate restart if the process dies.
- **Auto-restart** — exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 5s → 10s → 15s → 30s), up to 10 attempts before transitioning to network-wait.
- **Auth-wait system** — detects auth token expiry (Microsoft limitation), enters an auth-wait mode, polls for re-authentication via device code flow, and auto-reconnects once a fresh token is obtained.
- **Network-wait system** — detects DNS / connectivity errors (e.g. `ENOTFOUND`, `EAI_AGAIN`, `nodename nor servname`), enters a network-wait mode, probes the DevTunnel host via DNS every 60 seconds, and auto-reconnects once the network is reachable again. Network errors do not consume restart attempts, so transient outages (Wi-Fi sleep, DHCP renewal, ISP DNS blips) no longer cause a permanent giveup.
- **Token lifetime monitoring** — tracks the remaining lifetime of the DevTunnel auth token and emits warnings when less than 1 hour remains, giving the frontend time to prompt the user.
- **Event emitter** — exports `tunnelEvents` (EventEmitter) with events: `connected`, `disconnected`, `reconnecting`, `network-lost`, `network-restored`, `failed`. The server subscribes for logging.

Also exports `getLoginInfo()` (returns current auth provider and token expiry) and `parseLoginInfo()` (parses raw `devtunnel` CLI output into structured login metadata).

### `tunnel/install.js` — DevTunnel Installer

Handles automatic installation of the DevTunnel CLI when it's not found on the system. Prompts the user interactively and installs via the appropriate package manager (brew on macOS, curl on Linux, winget on Windows). Used by `server.js` during startup when tunnel mode is enabled.

### `cli/service.js` — PM2 Service Manager

Manages TermBeam as a background service via PM2. Provides an interactive wizard for `termbeam service install` that walks through configuration (name, password, port, access mode, working directory, log level, boot auto-start). Also handles `service status`, `logs`, `restart`, and `uninstall` subcommands. Generates an ecosystem config file at `~/.termbeam/ecosystem.config.js`.

### `cli/interactive.js` — Setup Wizard

Runs a step-by-step terminal wizard (in an alternate screen buffer) that walks the user through password, port, access mode, and log level configuration. Returns a config object compatible with `createTermBeamServer()`. Invoked by `bin/termbeam.js` when `--interactive` is passed. Uses prompt primitives from `prompts.js`.

### `cli/prompts.js` — Terminal Prompts

Provides ANSI color helpers (`green`, `yellow`, `red`, `cyan`, `bold`, `dim`) and interactive prompt functions (`ask`, `choose`, `confirm`, `createRL`). Extracted from `service.js` so both the service install wizard and the interactive setup wizard can share the same prompt primitives.

### `utils/vapid.js` — VAPID Key Management

Generates and persists VAPID key pairs for Web Push authentication. Keys are stored in `~/.termbeam/vapid.json` and reused across server restarts so that existing push subscriptions remain valid.

### `utils/update-check.js` — Update Checker

Checks the npm registry for newer versions of TermBeam. Fetches the latest published version from `registry.npmjs.org`, compares it against the running version using semver comparison (`isNewerVersion`), and caches the result for 24 hours in `~/.termbeam/update-check.json` to avoid repeated network requests. Includes `sanitizeVersion()` to strip ANSI escape sequences and control characters from registry responses (terminal injection protection). Also provides `detectInstallMethod()` which inspects environment variables to determine whether TermBeam was installed via npm, npx, yarn, or pnpm, returning the appropriate upgrade command.

### `utils/version.js` — Version Detection

Smart version detection with two paths: npm installs use the `package.json` version as-is, while local development derives the version from git tags. On a clean tag it shows `1.11.0`; when ahead of a tag or with uncommitted changes it shows `1.11.0-dev (v1.11.0-3-gabcdef1)`. Falls back to `package.json` when no semver tag exists.

### Frontend — React SPA

The frontend is a React 19 single-page application built with Vite and TypeScript, located in `src/frontend/`. It builds to `public/`, which Express serves as the static directory. Key dependencies include `@xterm/xterm` (npm package, not CDN), Zustand for state management, Radix UI for dialogs, `@dnd-kit` for drag-and-drop, and Sonner for toast notifications.

The terminal page includes several client-side features:

- **Terminal search** — <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd+F</kbd> opens a search bar overlay powered by the xterm.js `SearchAddon`. Supports regex matching with next/previous navigation.
- **Command completion notifications** — uses the browser Notification API to alert when a command finishes in a background tab. Toggled via a bell icon; preference stored in `localStorage` (`termbeam-notifications`).
- **Push notifications** — native push notifications via the Web Push API, delivered even when the browser tab is closed. The service worker (`sw.ts`) handles push events and uses the Badge API to show unread counts. Push subscription lifecycle (subscribe, unsubscribe, VAPID key mismatch detection) is managed by `services/pushSubscription.ts`.
- **Git changes view** — `GitChanges/`, `DiffViewer/`, and `BlameGutter/` components in the CodeViewer directory provide a full git integration UI: staged/unstaged diffs with syntax highlighting, per-line blame annotations, and commit history browsing.
- **Tools panel** — <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> / <kbd>Cmd+K</kbd> (or the floating ▦ button) opens a slide-out sheet with categorized actions (Session, Files, View, Share, Agents, Settings, System). Settings, the workspace launcher and the touch-bar key editor are inline panels reachable from this entry point.
- **Workspace autoboot (server-side)** — at startup `src/server/index.js` reads `~/.termbeam/prefs.json` and, if a workspace is flagged `default: true` (or there is exactly one named workspace, or the legacy `startupWorkspace.enabled` is true), spawns each session itself. This replaced the previous client-side autoboot so deleting a session in the UI stays deleted until the next service restart. When no workspace is configured the server falls back to a single default session in `config.cwd`.

### `client.js` — WebSocket Terminal Client

WebSocket terminal client used by the `resume` command. Handles raw-mode stdin/stdout piping, Ctrl+B detach, terminal resize synchronization via SIGWINCH, and scrollback replay on attach.

### `resume.js` — Resume & List Subcommands

Implements the `termbeam resume [name]` (alias: `termbeam attach`) and `termbeam list` CLI subcommands. Auto-discovers running servers via `~/.termbeam/connection.json`, lists sessions, provides an interactive arrow-key chooser when multiple sessions exist, and delegates terminal attachment to `client.js`.
